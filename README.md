# investigate-tmbd-dataset
Performing data analysis on the TMBD movie dataset.

This project constitutes a part of my Udacity Data Analyst Nanodegree program. The goal was to investigate and analyze the TMBD movie dataset. As part of this project, I was able to assess the dataset programmatically using pandas, perform some data cleaning, ask the right questions, and perform some exploratory data analysis (EDA) on the data.

The TMBD movie dataset consists of 10,866 movie instances and contains 21 attributes including the movie id, budget, revenue, title, cast, vote average of the movie etc. It contains some missing values and 1 duplicate feature, hence required some data cleaning to fix missing data, duplicates, e.t.c in the data.

The following questions were addressed and analyzed;
- What company has the highest number of movie production between 1960 and 2015?
- What is the most common genre type represented in the released movies?
- Who are the leading movie directors in the movie industry between 1960 and 2015?
- What year had the highest number of movies released between 1960 and 2015?
- What trend does the movie runtime display on an average from past years?

At the end of the project, I was able to explore and draw insights from the data while addressing the questions.
